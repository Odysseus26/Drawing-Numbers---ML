Hi, this is my first Machine Learning Progam

It takes drawings of numbers and detects which number it is

It only works for single digit numbers

Please give me any useful feedback

More detailed instructions are in the file "notes"

Also if you want to use Finder.js, put .JSON files in the file "GUESS"
